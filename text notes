Objects are a good way to group together data that have something in common or are somehow related. Also, thanks to the fact that property names are unique, objects come in handy when we have to separate data based on a unique condition.

STACKS
Stacks are a data structure that store information in the form of a list. They allow only adding and removing elements under a LIFO pattern (last in, first out). In stacks, elements can't be added or removed out of order, they always have to follow the LIFO pattern.
To understand how this works, imagine a stack of papers on top of your desk. You can only add more papers to the stack by placing them on top of all the others. And you can remove a paper from the stack only by taking the one that is on top of all the others. Last in, first out. LIFO.
